  bio: 'Dr. Kutzler joined Drexel University College of Medicine faculty in 2007, recruited from the University of Pennsylvania where she was a postdoc in the laboratory of David Weiner, the lab considered the founder of the area of DNA vaccines (Kutzler PI NIAID F32 National Research Service Award entitled, “TNT: targeting and triggering mucosal adjuvants for HIV-1 vaccines” F32AI054152).  She is the Assistant Dean of Faculty Development and Associate Professor of Medicine and Microbiology and Immunology. Dr. Kutzler’s laboratory research aims to develop effective DNA-based vaccines that target a wide range of pathogenic organisms including Influenza virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), as well as the bacterium Clostridium difficile.  Research focus ranges from understanding the mechanisms by which long-lasting protective immunity (immune correlates) against pathogenic organisms is acquired, to concepts in the development of next generation DNA-based vaccine platforms, modified antigenic design, novel delivery methods and use of molecular adjuvants to boost host immunity and improved vaccine efficacy. Dr. Kutzler was recognized as one of Drexel’s “REACH: Drexel’s up and coming Next Generation Junior Faculty” and received the faculty Young Scientist Award at Drexel University College of Medicine Discovery Day. Her laboratory has received funding from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Pfizer, Inc., MARS endowment for Aging Research, Pennsylvania Department of Health formula funds (CURE Award), WW Smith Trust Foundation and the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program.

  bio: Dr. Edward Botchwey is an Associate Professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia tech and Emory University. He serves as the director of the Laboratory for Immuno-Regenerative Engineering located in the The Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience (IBB) in the heart of midtown Atlanta. His group seeks to understand how inflammatory signals can be harnessed to improve tissue repair outcomes. This talk will describe investigations into metabolism and signaling of bioactive sphingolipids such as sphingosine 1-phosphate and pro-resolving lipid mediators for applications in regenerative engineering. Flow Cytometry based Immunophenotyping and pseudotime analysis of tissues treated with bioactive lipids will be used to investigate biphasic adhesion of pro-angiogenic monocyte and neutrophil subsets. Pre-clinical modeling results will show how non-classical monocytes serve as biased progenitors of pro-angiogenic, anti-fibrotic macrophages within excisional skin wounds and volumetric muscle loss injuries. Results will also show how local polarization of recruited monocytes toward tolerogenic immune subsets enhances the survival and engraftment of skin allografts in the absence of systemic immunosuppression.
